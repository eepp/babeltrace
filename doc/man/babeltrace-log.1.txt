NAME
----
babeltrace-log - Convert a Linux kernel ring buffer to a CTF trace


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*babeltrace-log* [opt:--with-timestamps] 'OUTPUT-PATH'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `babeltrace-log` tool reads the lines of a Linux kernel ring buffer,
as printed by the man:dmesg(1) tool, from the standard input stream and
converts them to a http://diamon.org/ctf/[CTF] trace written to the
'OUTPUT-PATH' directory.

Usage example:

[role="term"]
----
$ dmesg | babeltrace-log --with-timestamps my-trace
----

The events of the generated CTF trace are named `string` and contain a
single payload string field named `str` which contains the corresponding
ring buffer line.

By default, `babeltrace-log` does not try to extract the timestamps of
the kernel ring buffer lines to use them as the created events's
timestamps. A typical man:dmesg(1) line looks like this:

----
[87166.510937] PM: Finishing wakeup.
----

In the last example, the `[87166.510937]` part is a timestamp which
could be extracted. You can make `babeltrace-log` extract timestamps
from lines with the opt:--with-timestamps option.


OPTIONS
-------
opt:-t, opt:--with-timestamps::
    Extract timestamps from the kernel ring buffer lines: set
    the created event's payload's `str` field to the rest of the line,
    excluding any timestamp prefix.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
